								<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
							</header>

							<p>The job advertisement above pertains to the position of a front-end developer experienced in the programming language JavaScript at the company Piktochart (Piktochart 2019). The main focus of this job is to write JavaScript code as part of a team to further develop the company's presentation making web application (ibid.). This job is appealing to me because of the strong company values that resonate with my own personal beliefs. For example, Piktochart looks for passionate employees which aim to deliver the top visual communicative tool on the Internet (Piktochart 2019). This reflects on the high motivation that the company ascertains, making it an ideal working environment.</p>

							<p>The qualifications required for this job include being experienced with JavaScript or Front-end web development for applications for more than 3 years. Furthermore, this job requires expertise in the fundamentals of JavaScript and its libraries, HTML5, CSS3 and various other web programming languages and technologies. Additionally, experiences required include a firm grasp of writing JavaScript in Component Based Architecture framework, experience writing JavaScript in Functional and Reactive Programming Concept using libraries such as VueJS and Vuex, ReactJS and Redux, RxJS, and similar libraries. Familiarity with Back-end environments and the integration of server data into web applications is also needed. Further qualifications required include a passionate developer that is able to write structural code and adapt and improve existing code, a caring developer that is able to write automated test coverage for the ensuring of stability for the written application so it may work among various browsers, and proficiency in spoken English communication.
							</p>

							<p>Currently, I have basic proficiency in the programming language Python3 and I am learning the basics of Java and HTML. I am also proficient in both written and verbal communication in English. I have completed my secondary education and am enrolled in a foundation course concerning the subject of Information Technology.</p>

							<p>In order to attain the skills, qualifications, and experiences required for the position at Piktochart, I plan to enrol in the Bachelor of Information Technology course at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) by studying online through Open Universities Australia (OUA). This course will allow me to grow in knowledge in the field of Information Technology while equipping me with relevant knowledge for the position through its electives such as Scripting Language Programming which will serve as a foundation for familiarising myself with JavaScript (OUA 2019). Other relevant units include Web Development Technologies, Web Database Applications, and Web Programming (ibid.). Additionally, I am planning to study a minor in Internet Design under Curtain University during the duration of my undergraduate studies. The study of this minor will assist in building my experience with web programming technology and professional web design through its units such as Internet Project Development (OUA 2019). Further efforts to increase my experience and skill in these areas would be the development of several web-related projects in my personal free time over the course of my studies, using the knowledge I have acquired throughout the course, whilst actively learning in the course of developing these projects. The development of personal projects will increase my familiarity and confidence with the subject matter.
