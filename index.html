							<p>My name is Tee Ming Chew. My student number is s3812497 and I can be reached through my email address at ctming01@hotmail.com .</p>

							<p>I am a Chinese Malaysian born and raised in Penang. I am currently a student at RMIT preparing to enrol in the Bachelor of Information Technology degree program. I am able to fluently speak English and I am reasonably proficient in Malay.</p>

							<p>I help to manage and set up the audio visual system for my local church on a regular basis and for special events. I started out without much prior experience or knowledge but gained many new skills and broadened my range of understanding through providing assistance in this area.</p>

				<!-- Interest in IT -->
					<section id="interestinit" class="three">
						<div class="container">

							<header>
								<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
							</header>
							<p>My interest in Information Technology (IT) stems from the amazing innovation behind the development of technology by large companies and small projects created by a single person. From my perspective, technology is not limited by the capabilities of hardware, but rather by the creativity behind the idea of it. These innovative ideas benefit the general public in terms of health, entertainment, convenience, efficiency, accessibility, and various other areas. Refining the technology that is present is also beneficial, however, devices and services that offer new functionality to the public are the redefining instruments in our modern world today.</p>

							<p>My interest in IT started when I began playing computer games at a young age. I was captured by the different aspects of the various types of games that I had been exposed to. This ranged from the social aspects of online video games such as Maple Story and World of Warcraft, to the strategic resource management intensive games such as Civilisation 3 and Heroes of Might and Magic 4. However, this interest increased exponentially when I received my first portable video game console, the Nintendo DS Lite. I was captivated by the functionality of the device, being small and light-weight enough to carry around easily, while also having different methods of input for gameplay such as the microphone and touch screen functionality in contrast to the standard button controls.</p>

							<p>Although I have not had any professional experience in the world of IT, from a young age I have always immersed myself in discovering ways of making my entertainment more convenient or accessible. This included optimising the cheap computers that I had grown up with, fixing problems related to computer software, installing different operating systems, reconfiguring routers and modems so the internet connection would be smoother, for example.</p>

							<header>
								<h3><br>Why RMIT?</h3>
							</header>
							<p>I chose to study at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) because I wanted to gain the knowledge and skillset required by the IT industry in order to become a professional. I believe that RMIT will serve as a starting platform for me to develop my skills and expertise in this area. Moreover, the option of studying online at RMIT delivers a range of benefits in contrast to the traditional methods of learning more commonly available at other institutions of higher education. The efficiency that accompanies online learning will dramatically improve my educational experience and result in a stronger proficiency in the field of IT.</p>

							<header>
								<h3><br>Learning Expectations</h3>
							</header>
							<p>I expect to learn more about the IT industry, the skills required by employers, and the latest trends in IT, among other skills. The IT industry is wide and diverse, hence it is important to understand the different aspects of the world of IT. Among other things, I expect to learn about the applications of machine learning, Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing. However, the most important part of my studies is to build a firm foundation of core IT skills and programming concepts and practices. This foundation will solidify my ability to adapt as a programmer, whereby new technologies or programming languages may appear in the future. I also expect to learn project management skills that will allow me to facilitate and coordinate teams of IT professionals. It is a core ability in any industry to be able to function as part of a group and to lead and direct a group of individuals to work as a team. Collaborations are integral in the process of furthering the advancements of the IT industry.

							<p><br><br>The job advertisement above pertains to the position of a front-end developer experienced in the programming language JavaScript at the company Piktochart (Piktochart 2019). The main focus of this job is to write JavaScript code as part of a team to further develop the company's presentation making web application (ibid.). This job is appealing to me because of the strong company values that resonate with my own personal beliefs. For example, Piktochart looks for passionate employees which aim to deliver the top visual communicative tool on the Internet (Piktochart 2019). This reflects on the high motivation that the company ascertains, making it an ideal working environment.</p>

							<p>The qualifications required for this job include being experienced with JavaScript or Front-end web development for applications for more than 3 years. Furthermore, this job requires expertise in the fundamentals of JavaScript and its libraries, HTML5, CSS3 and various other web programming languages and technologies. Additionally, experiences required include a firm grasp of writing JavaScript in Component Based Architecture framework, experience writing JavaScript in Functional and Reactive Programming Concept using libraries such as VueJS and Vuex, ReactJS and Redux, RxJS, and similar libraries. Familiarity with Back-end environments and the integration of server data into web applications is also needed. Further qualifications required include a passionate developer that is able to write structural code and adapt and improve existing code, a caring developer that is able to write automated test coverage for the ensuring of stability for the written application so it may work among various browsers, and proficiency in spoken English communication.
							</p>

							<p>Currently, I have basic proficiency in the programming language Python3 and I am learning the basics of Java and HTML. I am also proficient in both written and verbal communication in English. I have completed my secondary education and am enrolled in a foundation course concerning the subject of Information Technology.</p>

							<p>In order to attain the skills, qualifications, and experiences required for the position at Piktochart, I plan to enrol in the Bachelor of Information Technology course at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) by studying online through Open Universities Australia (OUA). This course will allow me to grow in knowledge in the field of Information Technology while equipping me with relevant knowledge for the position through its electives such as Scripting Language Programming which will serve as a foundation for familiarising myself with JavaScript (OUA 2019). Other relevant units include Web Development Technologies, Web Database Applications, and Web Programming (ibid.). Additionally, I am planning to study a minor in Internet Design under Curtin University during the duration of my undergraduate studies. The study of this minor will assist in building my experience with web programming technology and professional web design through its units such as Internet Project Development (OUA 2019). Further efforts to increase my experience and skill in these areas would be the development of several web-related projects in my personal free time over the course of my studies, using the knowledge I have acquired throughout the course, whilst actively learning in the course of developing these projects. The development of personal projects will increase my familiarity and confidence with the subject matter.

							<p><br><br>The results of these 3 tests remind me to be aware of my personal strengths and weaknesses to improve upon my decision-making and communication skills. These tests have revealed a range of characteristics that accentuate my personality and style of learning. With better understanding of myself, I am able to actively make decisions that will produce optimal results based on my characteristics. For example, I may consciously pace myself regarding my studies in relation to the fact that individuals of my personality type often struggle during stressful encounters (NERIS Analytics Limited, 2019). Additionally, I have begun restructuring my style of learning to be more visual. Practical applications of this include illustrating new information as mind maps and spider diagrams.</p>

							<p>These results have encouraged me to consciously communicate more within the team and to be more assertive in regards to my lack of assertiveness and introverted personality (NERIS Analytics Limited, 2019). I am also currently more aware of my shyness in expressing criticism towards group members which shall embolden my efforts to provide constructive criticism. I believe that constructive criticism is a necessary form of providing feedback within a team to improve the quality of working together and of the work itself. In contrast, I am more confident in my ability to work with a variety of different group members due to my openness (Truity, 2019).</p>

							<p>As a result of understanding my own characteristics, I may recruit team members of different personality types, with the objective of having a well rounded team. Subsequently, working together with an extroverted and assertive individual may balance out the team dynamics in relation to my own personality (NERIS Analytics Limited, 2019). Moreover, I may be able to further develop personal extroverted and assertive qualities by observing and learning from team members with a different personality type. Similarly, my different personality traits may compliment the other team members and this will create a diverse and balanced working atmosphere for the team.</p>
